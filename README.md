# Pixel Forge

This is the workspace for Pixel Forge. It is an attempt to create a code-focused game engine that is
specifically for 2D pixel art RPGs.

It is currently a work in progress. It is not recommended for production use.
If you're brave enough to give it a try, please read the [documentation](https://story75.github.io/pixel-forge/) and report any problems you find.
