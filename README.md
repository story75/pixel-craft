# Pixel Forge

This is the workspace for Pixel Forge. It is an attempt to create a code focused game engine that is
specifically tailored to 2D pixel art RPGs.

Currently, this is very much a work in progress. It is not recommended to use this in production.
If you're brave enough to try it out, continue ahead and please report any issues you find.

## Getting Started

The best way to get started is check out the [documentation](https://story75.github.io/pixel-forge/).
