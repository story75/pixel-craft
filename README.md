# Archive notice

This project will no longer be updated. It will remain archived for people interested in a 2D WebGPU renderer and related features.

Developing the engine is one thing, making a game with it is another. Going too far into the 2D and code route was not feasible. Some creative features just work much better with a custom editor, and some 3d techniques can make working in 2d a lot easier.

For these reasons, the current approach fell short. The goal is still to continue at a later date, but with a different path and a different approach.

# Pixel Craft

This is the workspace for Pixel Craft. It is an attempt to create a code focused game engine that is specifically tailored to 2D pixel art RPGs.

## Why?

The main goal is to create a game engine that is easy to use, and that allows for rapid development of 2D pixel art games with TypeScript.
Current solutions did not fit my taste, so I decided to create my own and learn a lot in the process.

## Here be dragons

This is a work in progress, and it is not recommended for production use.
If you're brave enough to give it a try, please read the [documentation](https://story75.github.io/pixel-craft/) and report any problems you find.

## Contributing

The project is currently in a very early stage and more public source, than open source at the moment.
If you want to contribute, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests for existing features.
New features are not currently accepted, as the project is still in the design phase.
