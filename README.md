## Why?

The main goal is to create a game engine that is easy to use, and that allows for rapid development of 2D pixel art games with TypeScript.
Current solutions did not fit my taste, so I decided to create my own and learn a lot in the process.

## Here be dragons

This is a work in progress, and it is not recommended for production use.
If you're brave enough to give it a try, please read the [documentation](https://story75.github.io/pixel-craft/) and report any problems you find.

## Contributing

The project is currently in a very early stage and more public source, than open source at the moment.

New features are not currently accepted, as the project is still in the design phase.
